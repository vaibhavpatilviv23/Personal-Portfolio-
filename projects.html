                    This is the new version which is again made up by using Bootstrap framework.
                </p>

                <p>Note: This is incomplete project due to some reasons, but link is there to get to know the difference
                    between the old and this new one.
                    Do check it out the old one and this new one because it definitly shows the difference where I built
                    several different projects and then this one.
